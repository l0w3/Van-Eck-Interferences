# Van-Eck-Interferences

Although a thoroughly studied matter, in 1985, Wim Van Eck was the first researcher to publish unclassified information about what could possibly be done to spy on monitors from remote locations. In the original [paper](https://cryptome.org/emr.pdf) he even explains how they set a van with a big antena in front of a building in braod light to pick up the signal from a remote monitor and no-one asked anything, which I thought it was funny at least.

Jokes aside, his research showcased how even wired monitors (for the record, by that time every monitor was wired) could be eavesdropped by not-to expensive means if one had the skills to do so.
Several years after, Martin Marinov released [TempestSDR](https://github.com/martinmarinov/TempestSDR), a software that could be used to eavesdrop newer monitors using HDMI or VGA. This was particularly interesting to me and made research about this topic.

During my research I managed to eavesdrop a monitor connected to a laptop with a VGA cable using my HackRF and Marinov's software, which was super cool.
